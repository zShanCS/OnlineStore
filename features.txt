This application is capable of handling almost all operations that are required to be perfromed at cash counters in any local stores.

This includes adding items to cart, searching for price and quantity of items and much more.
(experimentally it can be used as "online shopping store" although it isnt capable of connecting to Internet yet)

Administration of a store can also login to this app and see all data.
Management staff can update prices of items, add new items, update quantity etc.

Cashiers can add and remove items from the list of the items current customer wants to buy and then print reciepts.

All shopping history is stored locally via file handling.
Customers can see their old reciepts whenver they want if they have an online account.
